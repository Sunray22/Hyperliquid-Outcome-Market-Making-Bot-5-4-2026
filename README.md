# Hyperliquid Outcome Market-Making Bot

A low-latency, multi-strategy market making and arbitrage bot for the new
**HIP-4 Outcome Markets** that went live on Hyperliquid mainnet on
**2 May 2026**. Written in Rust because every microsecond on the wire shows
up as either captured spread or adverse selection.

The bot trades three signals side by side, sharing one book cache and one
risk gate:

| # | Strategy                          | Goal                                                                  |
|---|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `avellaneda_stoikov` (MM)         | Capture spread by quoting both sides of HIP-4 YES + NO outcome books. |
| 2 | `cross_venue_arb`                 | Lift cheap leg / hit rich leg across HL / Polymarket / Kalshi.        |
| 3 | `btc_parity`                      | Trade the divergence between the BTC up/down outcome and the BTC perp. |

> ℹ **HIP-4 in one paragraph.** Hyperliquid HIP-4 introduces fully
> collateralised, on-chain prediction markets that share the same matching
> engine, account, and ~200 k orders / second throughput as Hyperliquid
> perps and spot. Each event has two tokens — `YES` and `NO` — that pay
> exactly **1 USDH** to the holder if they were correct at expiry, and
> **0 USDH** otherwise. Opening / minting is free; fees only apply on
> close, burn, or settle. The first contracts are daily BTC binary
> thresholds that reset at 06:00 UTC; the bot ships pre-configured for
> the very first one (`OUT:BTC-78213-2026-05-03-YES`).

Every connector emits a normalised `ConnectorEvent` (`Book`, `Trade`,
`Fill`, `OrderUpdate`, `Resyncing`, `Resynced`). The bot's main task drains
all three connectors via `tokio::select!`, updates the book cache, and
fans out to every strategy in zero allocations on the hot path
(`Arc<RwLock<…>>` + lock-free DashMap).

A second task drains strategy events, runs them through the risk gate, and
hands surviving orders to the right venue. Orders never bypass risk; risk
never blocks the receive path.

## Strategies and the math behind them

### Avellaneda-Stoikov market making

The classic stochastic-control market maker, adapted to a binary outcome
where the "mid" is itself the implied probability of YES.

For risk aversion `γ`, arrival intensity `κ`, realised variance `σ²` and
remaining time-to-expiry `T - t`, the reservation price and optimal
half-spread are

```
r(s, q, t) = s − q · γ · σ² · (T − t)
δ(t)       = γ · σ² · (T − t) + (1/γ) · ln(1 + γ/κ)

bid = r − δ                ask = r + δ
```

The half-spread surface — the actual quote width the bot is posting — looks
like this:

![Avellaneda-Stoikov half-spread surface](docs/diagrams/as_surface.png)

The mid `s` is the YES microprice (size-weighted top-of-book), clamped to
`[tick, 1 - tick]`. Inventory `q` is signed YES tokens. Quotes are
mirrored on the NO leg using `p_no = 1 - p_yes`; both legs share the same
matching engine on Hypercore so the maker captures liquidity rebates on
either side as the flow lands.

> Key implementation knobs (see `config/default.toml#strategy.avellaneda`):
> `gamma`, `kappa`, `min_size`, `max_inventory`, `vol_half_life_secs`,
> `tick`. The volatility estimator is an EWMA of `Δlog(p) / √Δt`; the
> first 10 seconds use a prior so cold-starts don't post stupidly wide.

### Cross-venue arbitrage

The same logical event ("BTC ≥ 78,213 USD at 03 May 2026 06:00 UTC") trades
on **at least three venues** today: Hyperliquid HIP-4, Polymarket and
Kalshi. After fees and bridging costs these prices ought to converge — but
they don't always.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Logical event
      EV[OutcomeKey { BTC, 7821300¢, 2026-05-03T06:00Z, ≥ }]
    end
    EV --> A[HL OUT:BTC-78213-...-YES]
    EV --> B[Polymarket condition_id 0xabc...]
    EV --> C[Kalshi BTC_2026-05-03_78213_YES]

    A -- 0.572 / 0.575 --> Q1[(quotes)]
    B -- 0.561 / 0.564 --> Q1
    C -- 0.580 / 0.583 --> Q1

    Q1 --> ARB{net edge ≥ min_edge_bps?}
    ARB -- yes --> ACT[buy cheap leg<br/>sell rich leg]
    ARB -- no  --> SKIP[wait]
```

The strategy iterates each tick:

1. Snapshot the YES top-of-book on every linked leg.
2. Find the cheapest ask and the richest bid.
3. Subtract per-venue fees (`fee_bps_per_venue`) plus Polygon bridging
   (`bridging_bps_polygon` for Polymarket).
4. If the surviving edge exceeds `min_edge_bps`, fire IOC orders on both
   legs simultaneously, sized to the smaller of the two top-level depths
   capped by `max_notional_usd`.

Visualised against time, the YES mids drift around each other; the white
ringed dots are points where the strategy fires:

![Cross-venue YES mid 3D walk](docs/diagrams/xvenue_3d.png)

> A real production deployment would also short-circuit through Hyperliquid's
> `mintOutcome` action when the *minted* round-trip (mint YES on HL → sell
> on Polymarket) is cheaper than buying YES on the open book — that's left
> as a follow-up because it requires a USDH treasury, which has nothing to
> do with strategy logic and a lot to do with operational plumbing.

### BTC up / down vs. perp parity

This is the most interesting signal — the binary outcome is exactly a cash
digital on the BTC mark price. Under the same risk-neutral measure that
prices the perp, the YES leg's no-arbitrage value is

```
P(YES) ≈ Φ((ln(S/K) − ½σ²τ) / (σ √τ))
```

where `S` is the perp microprice, `K` the strike, `σ` the realised
annualised vol of the perp, and `τ` the time to expiry in years. The bot
maintains an EWMA of `Δlog(S)² / Δt` to estimate `σ` and updates the
fair value continuously; whenever the YES mid drifts more than `min_edge`
away from the surface, the strategy fires:

| Edge sign         | Action on YES   | Hedge on perp        |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| YES rich  ( + )   | sell YES        | long BTC perp        |
| YES cheap ( − )   | buy YES         | short BTC perp       |

The perp leg size is the digital's **delta**:
`∂P/∂S = φ(d) / (S σ √τ)`. It is rebalanced any time the YES position
drifts by more than `delta_rebalance_thresh`, which means PnL only depends
on whether the YES leg returns to fair value — not on the realised path of
BTC.

![Black-Scholes digital surface](docs/diagrams/parity_surface.png)

The neon dot in the live dashboard plot marks the bot's current `(S, σ)`
point. Vertical distance from the surface is the strategy edge.

## Why Rust

Every microsecond between a HIP-4 book delta and a re-quoted post-only
order is either captured maker rebate or adverse selection. The hot path
budget on a quote turn is roughly

| Stage                                                      | budget       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| WS frame parse + book replay                               | ≤ 30 µs      |
| AS quote computation (one floating-point pass)             | ≤ 5 µs       |
| Risk check (DashMap lookups)                               | ≤ 3 µs       |
| msgpack + keccak + EIP-712 sign                            | ≤ 50 µs      |
| TLS write to `/exchange`                                   | ≤ 200 µs     |
| **Total local turn-around**                                | **≤ 300 µs** |

Rust gives us deterministic latency without a GC pause, native TLS over
`rustls`, and zero-copy WS parsing via `tokio-tungstenite`. The release
profile in `Cargo.toml` is configured for `lto = "fat"`,
`codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, which is what you actually want
in a trading binary that ought to fail fast.

> Comparable C++ would be *equivalent*. Go would not — its STW pauses
> show up directly in the latency histogram. A scripting language would
> not even keep up with the WS feed at peak.

## Performance dashboard

The bot ships with a built-in dashboard (`crates/dashboard`) at
**`http://127.0.0.1:8787`** by default. It serves a single HTML page,
streams snapshots over `/api/stream` (WebSocket, 4 Hz), and renders five
live views with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/):

- **Cumulative PnL by strategy** (line)
- **Avellaneda-Stoikov quote surface** (Plotly `surface` — interactive 3D)
- **Cross-venue divergence** (Plotly `scatter3d` — lines + markers)
- **BTC parity surface** with the live `(S, σ)` point
- **Top of book + open positions** tables
- **Strategy signals tail** (color-mapped scatter)

The KPI strip up top tracks realised PnL, equity peak, drawdown, market
data p50 / p99 latency, order RTT p50 / p99, and the kill-switch status:

![Performance dashboard preview](docs/diagrams/performance.png)

Reading the live JSON over the WS is also useful for off-bot consumers
(spreadsheets, Grafana, pagers); see `crates/dashboard/src/lib.rs` for
the snapshot schema.

## Configuration & running

1. **Toolchain.** Project pins to stable Rust via `rust-toolchain.toml`.
   Anything ≥ 1.85 works.
2. **Secrets.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   - `HL_OMM__VENUES__HYPERLIQUID_PK` — the EOA private key that owns
     your Hyperliquid account (or an API agent wallet).
   - Polymarket API triple (`KEY`, `SECRET`, `PASSPHRASE`, `MAKER`) and
     Kalshi RSA-PSS key path / id, if you want the cross-venue leg.
3. **Markets.** Edit `config/default.toml#strategy` to match the daily
   HIP-4 contract you want to trade. Tickers follow
   `OUT:<UNDERLYING>-<STRIKE>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<YES|NO>` (parsed by
   `outcome::parse_outcome_market_id`).
4. **Build & run:**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   RUST_LOG=hl_omm=info,info ./target/release/hl-omm-bot
   ```

5. **Open** `http://127.0.0.1:8787` for the live dashboard.
6. **Re-render the static plots** in this README at any time:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/render_plots.py
   ```

## Risk model & safety rails

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q[Strategy quote] --> C{check}
    C -->|kill switch?| K1[REJECT]
    C -->|open orders > cap?| K2[REJECT]
    C -->||q + Δq| > max?| RZ[RESIZE down]
    C -->|drawdown > limit?| KILL[set kill switch + REJECT]
    C -->|else| OK[PASS]
    OK --> EX[connector → exchange]
    RZ --> EX
```

- `max_gross_notional_usd` — soft cap on aggregate exposure across markets.
- `max_per_market_qty` — hard ceiling on a single market's net position.
- `max_open_orders_per_market` — guards against a runaway requote loop.
- `max_drawdown_usd` — flips the kill switch and rejects new orders.
- `stop_on_disconnect` — flatten + halt if any venue session is lost.

Risk decisions emit a `RiskDecision::{Pass, Resize(qty), Reject(why)}`;
the strategy router resizes when allowed and logs the rejection with the
breached limit otherwise.
